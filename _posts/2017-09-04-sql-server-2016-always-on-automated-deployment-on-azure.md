Hey folks,

I needed to create 2016 SQL AlwaysOn with Windows Server 2016 automated deployment for Azure. I took the [working, but outdated (sql2014-ws2012r2) example](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/sql-server-2014-alwayson-existing-vnet-and-ad) and modified it to suit my needs.  
Changes made:
1. It works with 2016sp1\2016 (at least at the time of writing)
2. It is using cloud witness (so 1 less vm to pay for)
3. I've removed as much legacy code as I could (without having to rewrite everything)
4. It runs in parallel (so all the dsc extensions start at the same time and work out their way)
5. Minor code clean-ups

xSqlServer module is the thing I've been using, but there are many issues with it, unfortunately. I've had to manually modify at least one place with a fix to make this work, I didn't have to investingate the issue because its documented in issues on the github, still it doesnt work without the workaround ;). I've had a few back and forths with the [module maintainer on twitter](https://twitter.com/johanljunggren) to get some basic idea about different things (I'm not really a sql guy).

All the samples I've been able to locate:

https://github.com/chagarw/MDPP/tree/master/301-sql-alwayson-mdÂ < SQL2016SP1-WS2016 (doesn't work)  
https://github.com/mspnp/reference-architectures/tree/master/sharepoint/sharepoint-2016 < sql2016-ws2016 (I didn't test, but will definitely fail with sql2016sp1)  
https://github.com/robotechredmond/301-sql-alwayson-md < SQL2016SP1-WS2016 (doesn't work)

The below is the first error you will run into when trying to deploy most of the examples above :), you will encounter many other errors after fixing this one ;).
```

```

 I've had to alter several dsc modules here and there to get this thing working end to end. I don't remember all of them at this point (probably shoulda take notes next time), sadly. I've had to alter `xSqlCreateVirtualDataDisk` to work with 2016 (as it didn't), this can be replaced with something like cdisk or cdisktools (but I'm unsure if they are in better shape), `xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup` or `xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroupListener` has a bug described [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer/issues/649) and [here's the link to a branch](https://github.com/johlju/xSQLServer/tree/fix-issue-649) with a fix.

 Among other top finds:

 1. xDatabase doesn't work with sql2016 (what year is this?). [Fix](https://github.com/PowerShell/xDatabase/pull/31), but nobody cares.
 2. xWebDeploy doesn't work at all (or how does it?).

 Links:

 1. [DSC modules](https://github.com/AvyanConsultingCorp/PCI_Reference_Architecture/tree/master/artifacts/configurationscripts)
 2. [ARM Template(s) reference that deploys those](https://github.com/AvyanConsultingCorp/PCI_Reference_Architecture/blob/master/templates/resources/application/azuredeploy.json). Note: Arm template that deploys sql needs to have vnet and domain already in place.. You will get a hard time trying to deploy this outside of that framework, so probably just copy out dsc extension\dsc scripts and use in your deployments.
