Long story short, I needed to deploy some classic resources using ARM Templates. I needed
classic Vnet, Storage, Cloud Service, Cloud Service Deployment and Cloud Service Certificate.
You can probably hack something else if you need it.

As this is not supported, so use at your own risk. [Template example](https://github.com/4c74356b41/armotron/blob/master/classicresources.json).
